# Custom Video Player with React and Video.js

This project implements a custom video player using React and the Video.js library. Custom CSS has been added to `src/App.css` to style the player, and configurations for Video.js, including theme settings, are defined in the `VideoJs.js` file. The actual player component is implemented in `Player.js`.
